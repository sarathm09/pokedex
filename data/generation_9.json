Moves that work based on the user's HP still do so; the doll's HP does not influence any move.  The doll will block major status effects, confusion, and flinching.  The effects of smelling salts and wake up slap do not trigger against a doll, even if the Pokémon behind the doll has the appropriate major status effect.  Multi-turn trapping moves like wrap will hit the doll for their regular damage, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate.  Moves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., avalanche, counter, or a rowap berry.  magic coat still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block.  Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like absorb are healed as normal.  It will also block acupressure, block, the curse effect of curse, dream eater, embargo, flatter, gastro acid, grudge, heal block, leech seed, lock on, mean look, mimic, mind reader, nightmare, pain split, psycho shift, spider web, sketch, swagger, switcheroo, trick, worry seed, and yawn.  A Pokémon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep.  The doll blocks intimidate, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked.  life orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.  The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes.  The doll is passed on by baton pass.  It keeps its existing HP, but uses the replacement Pokémon's stats and types for damage calculation.  All other effects work as normal.",

Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like absorb are healed as normal.  It will also block acupressure, block, the curse effect of curse, dream eater, embargo, flatter, gastro acid, grudge, heal block, leech seed, lock on, mean look, mimic, mind reader, nightmare, pain split, psycho shift, spider web, sketch, swagger, switcheroo, trick, worry seed, and yawn.  A Pokémon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep.  The doll blocks intimidate, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked.  life orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.  The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes.  The doll is passed on by baton pass.  It keeps its existing HP, but uses the replacement Pokémon's stats and types for damage calculation.  All other effects work as normal.",

Multi-turn trapping moves like wrap will hit the doll for their regular damage, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate.  Moves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., avalanche, counter, or a rowap berry.  magic coat still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block.  Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like absorb are healed as normal.

If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked.  life orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.  The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes.

If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way.  Abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.

This ability cannot ignore multitype at all.  An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pokémon's moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.

If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way.  Abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.  For example, cursed body only affects potential future uses of the move, while liquid ooze and shadow tag can only hinder a move's effect on the user.  This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle.  This ability cannot ignore multitype at all.  An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pokémon's moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.

If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way.

This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle.  This ability cannot ignore multitype at all.  An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pokémon's moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.

Moves that work based on the user's HP still do so; the doll's HP does not influence any move.  The doll will block major status effects, confusion, and flinching.  The effects of smelling salts and wake up slap do not trigger against a doll, even if the Pokémon behind the doll has the appropriate major status effect.  Multi-turn trapping moves like wrap will hit the doll for their regular damage, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate.  Moves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., avalanche, counter, or a rowap berry.  magic coat still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block.  Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like absorb are healed as normal.  It will also block acupressure, block, the curse effect of curse, dream eater, embargo, flatter, gastro acid, grudge, heal block, leech seed, lock on, mean look, mimic, mind reader, nightmare, pain split, psycho shift, spider web, sketch, swagger, switcheroo, trick, worry seed, and yawn.  A Pokémon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep.  The doll blocks intimidate, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked.  life orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.  The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes.  The doll is passed on by baton pass.  It keeps its existing HP, but uses the replacement Pokémon's stats and types for damage calculation.  All other effects work as normal.",

Multi-turn trapping moves like wrap will hit the doll for their regular damage, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate.  Moves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., avalanche, counter, or a rowap berry.  magic coat still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block.  Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like absorb are healed as normal.  It will also block acupressure, block, the curse effect of curse, dream eater, embargo, flatter, gastro acid, grudge, heal block, leech seed, lock on, mean look, mimic, mind reader, nightmare, pain split, psycho shift, spider web, sketch, swagger, switcheroo, trick, worry seed, and yawn.  A Pokémon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep.  The doll blocks intimidate, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked.  life orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.  The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes.  The doll is passed on by baton pass.  It keeps its existing HP, but uses the replacement Pokémon's stats and types for damage calculation.  All other effects work as normal.",

It will also block acupressure, block, the curse effect of curse, dream eater, embargo, flatter, gastro acid, grudge, heal block, leech seed, lock on, mean look, mimic, mind reader, nightmare, pain split, psycho shift, spider web, sketch, swagger, switcheroo, trick, worry seed, and yawn.  A Pokémon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep.  The doll blocks intimidate, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked.  life orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.  The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes.  The doll is passed on by baton pass.  It keeps its existing HP, but uses the replacement Pokémon's stats and types for damage calculation.  All other effects work as normal.",

If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way.  Abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.  For example, cursed body only affects potential future uses of the move, while liquid ooze and shadow tag can only hinder a move's effect on the user.  This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle.  This ability cannot ignore multitype at all.  An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pokémon's moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.

If the user cannot pay the HP cost, this move will fail.  The doll takes damage as normal, using the user's stats and types, and will break when its HP reaches zero.  Self-inflicted damage from confusion or recoil is not absorbed.  Healing effects from opponents ignore the doll and heal the user as normal.

The effects of smelling salts and wake up slap do not trigger against a doll, even if the Pokémon behind the doll has the appropriate major status effect.  Multi-turn trapping moves like wrap will hit the doll for their regular damage, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate.  Moves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., avalanche, counter, or a rowap berry.  magic coat still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block.  Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like absorb are healed as normal.

A Pokémon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep.  The doll blocks intimidate, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked.  life orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.  The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes.

If the user cannot pay the HP cost, this move will fail.  The doll takes damage as normal, using the user's stats and types, and will break when its HP reaches zero.  Self-inflicted damage from confusion or recoil is not absorbed.  Healing effects from opponents ignore the doll and heal the user as normal.  Moves that work based on the user's HP still do so; the doll's HP does not influence any move.  The doll will block major status effects, confusion, and flinching.  The effects of smelling salts and wake up slap do not trigger against a doll, even if the Pokémon behind the doll has the appropriate major status effect.  Multi-turn trapping moves like wrap will hit the doll for their regular damage, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate.  Moves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., avalanche, counter, or a rowap berry.  magic coat still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block.  Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like absorb are healed as normal.  It will also block acupressure, block, the curse effect of curse, dream eater, embargo, flatter, gastro acid, grudge, heal block, leech seed, lock on, mean look, mimic, mind reader, nightmare, pain split, psycho shift, spider web, sketch, swagger, switcheroo, trick, worry seed, and yawn.  A Pokémon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep.  The doll blocks intimidate, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked.  life orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.  The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes.  The doll is passed on by baton pass.  It keeps its existing HP, but uses the replacement Pokémon's stats and types for damage calculation.  All other effects work as normal.",

Moves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., avalanche, counter, or a rowap berry.  magic coat still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block.  Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like absorb are healed as normal.  It will also block acupressure, block, the curse effect of curse, dream eater, embargo, flatter, gastro acid, grudge, heal block, leech seed, lock on, mean look, mimic, mind reader, nightmare, pain split, psycho shift, spider web, sketch, swagger, switcheroo, trick, worry seed, and yawn.  A Pokémon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep.  The doll blocks intimidate, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked.  life orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.  The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes.  The doll is passed on by baton pass.  It keeps its existing HP, but uses the replacement Pokémon's stats and types for damage calculation.  All other effects work as normal.",

Moves that work based on the user's HP still do so; the doll's HP does not influence any move.  The doll will block major status effects, confusion, and flinching.  The effects of smelling salts and wake up slap do not trigger against a doll, even if the Pokémon behind the doll has the appropriate major status effect.  Multi-turn trapping moves like wrap will hit the doll for their regular damage, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate.  Moves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., avalanche, counter, or a rowap berry.  magic coat still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block.  Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like absorb are healed as normal.  It will also block acupressure, block, the curse effect of curse, dream eater, embargo, flatter, gastro acid, grudge, heal block, leech seed, lock on, mean look, mimic, mind reader, nightmare, pain split, psycho shift, spider web, sketch, swagger, switcheroo, trick, worry seed, and yawn.  A Pokémon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep.  The doll blocks intimidate, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked.  life orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.  The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes.  The doll is passed on by baton pass.  It keeps its existing HP, but uses the replacement Pokémon's stats and types for damage calculation.  All other effects work as normal.",

It will also block acupressure, block, the curse effect of curse, dream eater, embargo, flatter, gastro acid, grudge, heal block, leech seed, lock on, mean look, mimic, mind reader, nightmare, pain split, psycho shift, spider web, sketch, swagger, switcheroo, trick, worry seed, and yawn.  A Pokémon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep.  The doll blocks intimidate, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked.  life orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.  The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes.  The doll is passed on by baton pass.  It keeps its existing HP, but uses the replacement Pokémon's stats and types for damage calculation.  All other effects work as normal.",

If the user cannot pay the HP cost, this move will fail.  The doll takes damage as normal, using the user's stats and types, and will break when its HP reaches zero.  Self-inflicted damage from confusion or recoil is not absorbed.  Healing effects from opponents ignore the doll and heal the user as normal.

The effects of smelling salts and wake up slap do not trigger against a doll, even if the Pokémon behind the doll has the appropriate major status effect.  Multi-turn trapping moves like wrap will hit the doll for their regular damage, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate.  Moves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., avalanche, counter, or a rowap berry.  magic coat still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block.  Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like absorb are healed as normal.

A Pokémon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep.  The doll blocks intimidate, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked.  life orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.  The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes.

Self-inflicted damage from confusion or recoil is not absorbed.  Healing effects from opponents ignore the doll and heal the user as normal.

The effects of smelling salts and wake up slap do not trigger against a doll, even if the Pokémon behind the doll has the appropriate major status effect.  Multi-turn trapping moves like wrap will hit the doll for their regular damage, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate.  Moves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., avalanche, counter, or a rowap berry.  magic coat still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block.  Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like absorb are healed as normal.

A Pokémon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep.  The doll blocks intimidate, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked.  life orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.  The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes.
